NEEDS HELP KIVA...




The way to create the life you really want comes down becoming what you most want... which is abundance.   Which means it’s about restoring you back to your natural state of being and helping you to step into your natural brilliance.  This includes accessing your child-like feelings of awe, beauty, creativity and connection with Mother Nature and Source.   Accessing the parts that have been trapped inside for so long you can barely remember they are a part of you.   ...


Once you make the commitment to change your course of direction, professionally and personally, what seems far out of reach begins to materialize.  It is that simple.  You just need some assistance and guidance  to help you to where you want to go.


Infinite Abundance is created to help you do just that...

   <section class="section-five">


As part of the Infinite Abundance Challenge, over a 21 day period you will learn how to:


Unpack and release the clutter that you are holding onto in your physical and emotional body so your natural state of brilliance can shine through.
Discover what is most important to you and why -- all because you are now able to access the most creative parts of your being easily and effortlessly.
Become a conscious creator of the life you really want to be living because you are learning how to expand your consciousness at will -- so you can be open to receive all that you want, when you want it.  Without the pressure to do anything other than what you most want to be doing.

My name is Leisa Peterson.  I am a mom, wife, money expert and life coach to entrepreneurs.  I know what it feels like to have everything I could ever dream of and still not be happy.  Even though I had a healthy and loving family, plenty of money, and a skyrocketing career, I was so caught up in the weeds that I couldn’t enjoy life.   Lack and scarcity thoughts were driving nearly all of my decisions.  This kept me from living on purpose and not fulfilling my potential.


My unhappiness led me on a spiritual journey over 17 years ago to discover the true meaning of life and along the way I found myself drawn to understanding what it means to live in abundance.   This was a very unfamiliar path after having worked in the scarcity-minded world of finance for over 20 years.   After many years of epiphanies and breakthroughs that chipped away at my feelings of lack I started to see a whole new world emerge.  It turns out that abundance had been a part of me all along but I just couldn’t see it.


I then began sharing my experiences with others and they started having quick and life changing breakthroughs of their own.  Seeing the world in completely new ways and enjoying their lives through the lens of joy, peace and abundance.  It was then that I knew my discoveries must be shared with the world.  Which is why I created this new program for you to enjoy.


Since delving into the world of abundance, I’ve embarked on a journey of downsizing my belongings while upsizing my potential.  This includes selling our family estate, traveling the world, living in Hawaii and settling in majestic Sedona, AZ.  I live a life beyond my wildest dreams and I love helping others to create this same life for themselves.

   <section class="section-seven">

One of the most profound teachings I stumbled upon that I’ve never seen anywhere before is the fact that lack and scarcity is actually hidden in 7 major energy parts of the body.   These energy centers are called chakras and through the practices I’ve developed anyone can learn how to  visually and emotionally clear the body of this toxicity so that it no longer holds you hostage.


As part of the Infinite Abundance program you will learn not only how to clear your chakras of lack and scarcity but also how to create what you most want from the deepest parts of your being.  Once you complete these two stages you are then masterfully guided through a journey of expansion of consciousness so that you can continue to tune your awareness for receiving all that you want into the future.

   <section class="section-eight">



Here is what you will receive by participating in the 21 day Infinite Abundance Challenge:


Week 1
Energy Clearing For Abundance
Learn how to clear your chakras of the emotional baggage and obstacles that are holding you back from your natural state of creativity, joy and abundance.  Once learned, you will never forget it and it will likely become part of your regular daily meditation practice.  Imagine that this is like giving yourself and emotional car wash anytime you wish so you can approach every day with a free, clear and peaceful way of being.


Week 2
Discover a new way of planning for your business that lights up your entire way of being.  Digging deep to discover what you most want from a place of clarity and confidence so that you have a clear gauge for making decisions about how to spend your time.  To ensure you have certainty about the actions you’re taking to create the life you want to be living.


Week 3
Step into your fullest power as a conscious being.  By learning how to expand your awareness to the level that ensures success you will become a conscious creator of your life and business.  During this third week of the challenge you will practice mindset expansion exercises that allow you to notice when you have closed your energy due to hardships and what to do to shift into a state of open receiving so that all you want comes easily into your reach.
