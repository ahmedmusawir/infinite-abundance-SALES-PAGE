                  My name is Leisa Peterson.
                
               </h1>


               <h3>
                      I am a mom, wife, money expert and life coach to entrepreneurs.  I know what it feels like to have everything I could ever dream of and still not be happy.  Even though I had a healthy and loving family, plenty of money, and a 
      
                     <img src="http://www.leisapeterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/5.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-left leisa-bio-1" />

                      skyrocketing career, I was so caught up in the weeds that I couldn’t enjoy life.   Lack and scarcity thoughts were driving nearly all of my decisions.  This kept me from living on purpose and not fulfilling my potential.

               </h3>

               <!-- <img src="http://www.leisapeterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/final-2.png" class="img-responsive pull-right" /> -->

               <h3>
                     My unhappiness led me on a spiritual journey over 17 years ago to discover the true meaning of life and along the way I found myself drawn to understanding what it means to live in abundance.   This was a very unfamiliar path after having worked in the scarcity-minded world of finance for over 20 years.   After many years of epiphanies and breakthroughs that chipped away at my feelings of lack I started to see a whole new world emerge.  It turns out that abundance had been a part of me all along but I just couldn’t see it.

               </h3>

               <img src="http://www.leisapeterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/6-500x333.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right leisa-bio-2" />

               <h3>
                  
                    I then began sharing my experiences with others and they started having quick and life changing breakthroughs of their own.  Seeing the world in completely new ways and enjoying their lives through the lens of joy, peace and abundance.  It was then that I knew my discoveries must be shared with the world, which is why I created this new program for you to enjoy.

               </h3>

               <h3>

                     Since delving into the world of abundance, I’ve embarked on a journey of downsizing my belongings while upsizing my potential.  This includes selling our family estate, traveling the world, living in Hawaii and settling in majestic Sedona, AZ.  I live a life beyond my wildest dreams and I love helping others to create this same life for themselves.

            <h3>
                  One of the most profound teachings I stumbled upon that I’ve never seen anywhere before is the fact that lack and scarcity is actually hidden in 7 major energy parts of the body.   These energy centers are called chakras and through the practices I’ve developed anyone can learn how to  visually and emotionally clear the body of this toxicity so that it no longer holds you hostage.
            </h3>


            <h3>
                  As part of the Infinite Abundance program you will learn not only how to clear your chakras of lack and scarcity but also how to create what you most want from the deepest parts of your being.  Once you complete these two stages you are then masterfully guided through a journey of expansion of consciousness so that you can continue to tune your awareness for receiving all that you want into the future.
